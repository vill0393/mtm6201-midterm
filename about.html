                        the world for the depth of his understanding and for his unique approach to teaching the art,

                        and practicing yoga, which is now taught under his name. Iyengar yoga is the most widely practiced 
                        method of yoga in the world and its principles have been incorporated into the teaching of yoga 
                        under other names.

                        <p>
                        Mr. Iyengar was also a pioneer in the therapeutic applications of yoga to the treatment of numerous 
                        medical conditions and physical problems. Medical professionals and researchers in many disciplines 
                        and countries have recognized the efficacy of his method. You can find his influence in many forms 
                        of exercise, therapy and movement.
